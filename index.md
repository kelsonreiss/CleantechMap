# *A My Climate Journey Hackathon Project*
Team: Julien Soufflet, Will Jackowitz, [Kelson Reiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelson-reiss/)

### Vision
We aim to build an interactive resource that visualizes the climate space in a **problem-oriented** way. For example, we hope this will be a bridge between Project Drawdown's [Solutions Table](https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions) and a database of organizations tackling those solutions, organized in an intuitive and accessible way.

### Rough Interactive MVP
*Click on the dark grey nodes to expand or collapse. Vertical Scroll doesn't work yet.*

### Plenty to fix
1. Vertical scroll 
2. More info per node
3. Better colors
4. Easier way to update graph. Right now you have to manually update the JSON file. 

## If you're a web developer and interested, we could use your help!
