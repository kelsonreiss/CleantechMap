# *A My Climate Journey Hackathon Project*

### Vision
We aim to build an interactive resource that visualizes the climate space in a **problem-oriented** way. For example, we hope this will be a bridge between Project Drawdown's [Solutions Table](https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions) and a database of organizations tackling those solutions, organized in an intuitive and accessible way.

*Note: specific organizational structure is TBD. The general idea is a hierarchical graph, with each node containing relevant resources: companies, organizations, links to articles, etc. As you go further "down" the tree, it gets more narrowly focused. So, while you might start at "Energy", in 8 clicks you're at the node "Software" under "Site Planning for Residential Solar", where you'll find [Aurora](https://www.aurorasolar.com/)*

### Rough Interactive MVP
*Click on the dark grey nodes to expand or collapse. Vertical Scroll doesn't work yet.*

Created with [Oberservable.hq](https://observablehq.com/@kelsonreiss/cleantech-market-map). Great tool - I see it as the Jupyter Notebook of data visualization.

### Plenty to fix
1. Vertical scroll 
2. More info per node
3. Better colors
4. Easier way to update graph. Right now you have to manually update the JSON file. 

## If you're a web developer and interested, we could use your help!
